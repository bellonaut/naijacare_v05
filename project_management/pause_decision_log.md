# Project Pause Decision Log

**Date of Decision**: September 18, 2025  
**Decision Maker**: Project Lead (Bashir A. Bello)  
**Review Date**: January 2026 (or upon legal clearance)

## Trigger Events
- 2025-09-05: TIKO partnership blocked by in-person exam requirement
- 2025-09-12: Meta data storage conflict confirmed by legal counsel
- 2025-09-15: AI liability insurance quotes exceed project budget by 400%

## Decision Rationale
NaijaCare will pause clinical deployment while legal blockers are resolved. The
team will preserve research artifacts, maintain internal prototypes for
non-clinical routing demonstrations, and continue legal due diligence to avoid
premature deployment that could jeopardize patient safety or regulatory
compliance.
