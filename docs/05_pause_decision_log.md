# Pause Decision Log

## Event: Project Paused (Early 2025)

### Context
After ~18 months of concept + workflow design, had a conversation with an NGO implementation partner in Hausa.
They asked: "Who is responsible if someone gets hurt? What's your liability insurance?"

### Response
- No liability insurance
- No clinical partnerships (no one taking responsibility)
- No regulatory approval process
- No consent/privacy infrastructure

### Decision
**Stop.** It would be unethical to continue without these.

### Why the Pause Matters
This is not a technical pause. The code works. The routing logic is sound for a prototype.

**The pause is legal/governance.** The technical feasibility exposed the absence of institutional responsibility.

## What the Pause Clarified
1. **Law > Code:** You cannot code your way out of liability and regulatory uncertainty.
2. **Partnerships First:** Any real system requires explicit organizational responsibility.
3. **Governance Scaffolding:** Consent, audit, privacy, SLAs—these are not afterthoughts.

## Path Forward (If Ever Resumed)
- Formal partnership with a recognized clinic/hospital/NGO
- Legal review (Nigeria health law specialist)
- Clinical validation (licensed physicians)
- Regulatory pre-engagement
- Only *then* would engineering be warranted

## Lesson for This Portfolio
This project demonstrates mature engineering judgment: recognizing when code is not the bottleneck.
