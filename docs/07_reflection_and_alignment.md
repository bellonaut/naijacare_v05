# Governance Reflection & Alignment

## What This Shows

### 1. Real-World Problem Recognition
- Identified a genuine gap in low-bandwidth telehealth
- Designed a concrete workflow (message routing, async response)
- Prototyped functional code

### 2. Governance Maturity
- Recognized that *technical feasibility ≠ legitimacy*
- Identified liability, regulatory, and partnership gaps
- **Paused** rather than shipped something irresponsible

### 3. Legal Humility
- Understood that law is not an afterthought
- Acknowledged the limits of engineering
- Sought (but didn't find) legal scaffolding *before* scaling

## The Framing

> I documented and prototyped a WhatsApp-first consult routing workflow for low-bandwidth settings (NaijaCare) and paused it in Aug 2025 after implementation guidance highlighted unresolved liability and governance gaps. The technical prototype works; the legal and institutional prerequisites do not. This taught me that technology alone cannot solve problems in regulated domains.

## Why This Matters in Regulated Domains

- Shows ethical judgment and risk awareness
- Demonstrates cross-domain thinking (tech + law + health)
- Explains the boundary between engineering and regulation

## The Repository
This is intentionally published as "documentation + prototype," not "product announcement":
- Clear status: paused, non-clinical
- Governance memos, not hype
- Minimal, simulated code
- Reflects the pause decision, not a pivot or restart

**TL;DR for reviewers:** This is what intellectual honesty looks like in a tech project. It's about knowing when to stop.
