# NaijaCare

**Status:** Paused prototype (documentation + exploratory code only)  
**Clinical use:** ❌ Not for clinical use  
**Deployment:** ❌ Not deployed

NaijaCare is a WhatsApp-first telehealth workflow prototype designed for **low-bandwidth settings**.
This repository exists as a **public consolidation** of exploratory work and governance reflection.

## What exists
- A minimal, runnable **routing prototype** (simulated messages only)
- Documentation on **risk, legitimacy, and governance**
- A clear **pause decision** (late August 2025)

## What does not exist
- No patient data
- No deployment
- No pilots or clinical partners
- No legal advice

## Timeline
- 2024–2025: Concept + workflow design
- **Late Aug 2025:** Paused after NGO implementation guidance flagged unresolved liability and infrastructure gaps
- 2026: Public prototype + documentation

## Why this matters
The technical workflow was feasible. The legal and governance scaffolding was not.
This project clarified why **law—not more code—was the limiting factor**.

See `docs/` for details.
