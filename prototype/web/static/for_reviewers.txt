This is a non-clinical prototype demonstration for portfolio purposes only.

For reviewers: The code is intentionally minimal and simulated. It demonstrates:
- A routing workflow concept for low-bandwidth settings
- Privacy-preserving audit logging (hashed IDs, truncated messages)
- Consent gates and consent tracking
- Why governance, not code, was the actual blocker

See docs/ for the pause decision rationale.
