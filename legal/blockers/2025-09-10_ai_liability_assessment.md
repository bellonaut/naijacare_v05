# AI Liability Assessment (Nigeria Consumer Protection Act)

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Prepared by**: Legal Research (NaijaCare)

## Summary
AI-assisted routing outputs may be considered a product or service under the
Nigeria Consumer Protection Act. If an AI output contributes to harm, NaijaCare
could face strict liability claims without adequate insurance coverage.

## Findings
- AI-assisted triage is likely to be interpreted as a product feature that
  influences clinical decision-making.
- Strict liability exposure is heightened where automated systems are used in
  healthcare contexts.
- Liability insurance quotes for AI-enabled health products increased by ~400%
  relative to baseline coverage.

## Recommendation
- Maintain a human-in-the-loop design with explicit clinician responsibility.
- Pause ML-based decisioning until insurance and indemnity coverage are
  confirmed.
